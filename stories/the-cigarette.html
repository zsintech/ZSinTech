                <p>The cold cement called to me. I wished I wasn't hovering over it. I was frustrated just imagining the relief I would feel from landing my feet on the ground. Surely, the cold shock would stop the bleeding. At the very least, it would distract me from the pain.</p>

                <p>Drop. Drop. I watched as my blood hardened and froze moments after hitting the floor. Tiny pricks numbed my arms. Being numb kept them warm despite the draft that kept swooshing in from the door they deliberately left ajar. I tried to know what was out there, but my neck stopped holding my head up a while back. Maybe around the ninth or tenth round. I was not sure.</p>

                <p>The man, this reptile, looked at me from under his eyebrows. I strained to stare him down, watching as his head writhed from side to side of its own accord. But it could have been my spine failing my line of sight.</p>

                <p>He had these small darting eyes that made me feel more constrained than the ropes around my wrists. His movements were slow and deliberate yet weightless. Undetectable. If I closed my eyes, he was nonexistent, but my eyelids felt too foreign to me. I heard giggling—my daughter, my friends, and my brothers—and that smell…smelled like the meat I grilled for my brothers that day. It overpowered the pungent smell of blood and urine in the room. The odd smell started intermingling with the smell of sulfur. That's where the match sound came from. He had lit a cigarette. I gaped at it wistfully. I couldn't stop my tongue from slithering across my lips. Sharp edges of dried skin stabbed against it. He turned his head ever so slightly to the side, mocking me. The smell of burnt flesh was getting stronger. The creature started to cackle then, his voice echoing in the halls. I must have been screaming because my throat was harrowing in pain. A heavy wave of dust covered my vision.</p>

                <p>They had enough pity to lower the chains when we fainted, which happened often, as you might imagine. I was roused by his unforgiving military boots distorting my face with pressure. I recoiled as the steel shanks of his boot pulled at the hair on my face. When I was able to get a glimpse of him, his face was a distorted smirk. Then, with all the menace his words could carry, he told me, "Don't sleep just yet, birdie."</p>

                <p>From across the room, I heard laughter and Ali's unmistakable grunts. I would know it anywhere; he was not the man to show his pain. He always tried to be more stoic than anyone should. His father raised him to be a manly man. To the amusement of his handlers, he would grunt, then shake his head, determined to keep the ghost of his father proud.</p>

                <p>"Dance little bird, dance for us and we will let you go." They sang the words incoherently as they kicked him whenever his body swung towards one of them.</p>

                <p>They wanted to know if we aided our brothers up there, if we fed them. "Those who joined the resistance are not your brothers; they are traitors and should be shunned," they'd warn us. Isolated from family, alone so that all their attempts were futile. I understood why they felt threatened. To them, my brothers were fanatics who had nothing to lose. The truth is, most of us—even those not fighting back alongside our brothers—felt like they had nothing to lose. That was difficult for these men to understand. Their minds could not fathom why we wanted to help the resistance. You see, citizens were under state rations as is. It barely fed a family of four. Our rice quotas had rat poison in them. In fact, Baathist military men also had a limiting diet. Saddam kept them under a strict regimen of protein-rich meals. He was repulsed by the rolls of blubber that his commanders sported before he took over. He even enrolled his ministers into a rigorous military training program. The tell-tale sign of a Baathist dog lay in his stout body and jet-black mustache.</p>

                <p>All I really wanted was to sleep. Sleep or smoke. Sleep or smoke. I thought of when I taught her to wrap my cigarettes. It tasted better with her lipstick stains on it—the way she kissed the edges, winking at me as she wrapped it. He was closer to me now; I could smell the henna reeking out of his pores. Whoever colored his mustache for him was meticulous. You could barely see the white strands of hair he ought to have. But his sweat was darker than it should be; his henna had not dried too well yet. I assumed that was why its hideous odor was so pungent. "I would give you one of mine if you'd tell me, birdie." I looked at the cigarette. A trail of black sweat from his paint job slowly soaked into it. No lipstick stains, I thought. I closed my eyes. "Please just let me sleep.'' He kicked the raw blisters on my lower back.My attempts had him snickering. He turned to his men and motioned them over to Ali and me.</p>

                <p>Qadir was muttering something, some apology that I would have been too weak to knock out of him, even if I wasn't restrained. It was too late and as futile as they wanted it to be. The men pulled me down from the chains. I realized that even if I could muster the strength to fight back, I wouldn't. What was the point? Ali was partially unconscious when the man thrashed him down. Startled, he looked over at me. I remember envying his mere startlement. He did not know.</p>

                <p>The room they took us to was too bright, too white, too soon. The first thing I noticed was the boxes. Myriads of rings, watches, family heirlooms, and even what looked like a Victorian mirror were piled on each other. You could see the rust on some of the metals; they had been here a while. They had sworn up and down that the families would get them back.</p>

                <p>The strange thing about being cramped in a waiting room for your own imminent death is solidarity. There were Shia and Sunni sheikhs reciting the Quran like brothers. A slight tinge of jealousy rose up to my throat like bile, or was it tears? I looked away. Ali was smoking like he wanted to race to his impending death. He knew early on that for each cent's worth of things he offered to the guards, he would get a cigarette. His toes were turning blue, but he didn't seem to mind or even notice how he shivered like an old dog.</p>

                <p>In there, time crawled slower than an ant did. What's more, we watched it with mundane fascination. There was no fear in our hearts, just serene acceptance. I, however, felt some grievance over Qadir. I could only hope that he didn't give any information about the locations. He mustn't have. He would not; would he? I debated back and forth in my head, but in my heart of hearts, I knew. He was not in here with us after all. At the time, though, admitting that to myself would have sent me into hysterics. I had kept some composure so far. I had to ration the apparent truths over the long hours they kept me in there. I was adamant to keep sane.</p>

                <p>That night, I dreamt of my daughter. I also dreamt of her. She was in that flowy red dress she loved to wear to picnics. They were jumping up and down as if to cheer me on, their braids haphazardly swinging all over the place. A large river separated us, but I did not care. I dived headfirst, and the water instantly burned my eyes. Each time that I threw my arms, my muscles convulsed to work against my efforts. So I would forget to hold my breath, allowing ripples of salt to pass, unencumbered, down my throat. I don't think I was ever in a body of water for that long. Finally, in what felt like an eternity, I reached them. I reached her.</p>

                <p>One of the sheikhs was shaking my shoulders, while his friend was reciting Quran passages over me. Cold sweat was soaking my shirt; they looked worried. When I told them the contents of my dream, they whispered amongst themselves, and then smiling as if the joy was their own, they declared that it meant I would get out of here. A strange, loud rumble escaped my belly. Then spasms of laughter rolled out of me, and I could not stop it. Somehow, seeing the shadow of offense and bewilderment that colored the Sheikh's face did not help my case. I laughed until I coughed up what must have been some small part of my lungs.</p>

                <p>Before the morning prayers of our second night, I heard metallic keys scraping the door. Almost everyone straightened up. My heart thumped against my chest; one would assume it was just brought back to life because the blood rushed to and through my face, and a deafening roar diverted my senses. Ali was amused by my stupefied look. "Was it all bravado, Fathi? Are you going to die a coward?"</p>

                <p>It turned out that some of us were being let go, and by "we," I meant the Sunnis. That included me, Ali, and two other Sheikhs. Soon after that, we would find out that some larger-than-life Sheikh had convinced Saddam to show some leniency to his people. He somehow managed to get it through Saddam's skull that a good leader was also merciful.</p>

                <p>Not that it did us any good in the long run.</p>
