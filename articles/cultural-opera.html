                <p>Wishing everyone a very blessed Eid! I'm returning from my hiatus with reflections on numerous topics. Interestingly, my break coincided unintentionally with Ramadan, and honestly, I believe I wouldn't have derived the same insights at any other time of year.</p>

                <p>Previously, I shared that this platform is an expression of the diverse cultural environments I grew up in. That cultural blend has been evident in the food, clothing, decor, and everything else I've shared with you.</p>

                <p>My greatest joy, however, arises from the ongoing exploration and exposure to various art forms and sciences, enriching my cross-cultural performance. Recently, I had the chance to watch several celebrated operas. Though delightful on their own, viewing them through alternative lenses enhances their enjoyment significantly, particularly intellectually.</p>

                <p>Take, for instance, Mozart's "The Abduction from the Seraglio," a humorous Singspiel set in Turkey. The protagonist, a European nobleman, seeks to reclaim his beloved Konstanze, who is held captive in a Pasha's harem. Interestingly, this Pasha is portrayed sympatheticallyâ€”a converted Christian exiled by the protagonist's father, gentle and forgiving. Conversely, the true antagonist is an uptight and possessive Turkish Muslim who succumbs to drunkenness in praise of Bacchus. Thus, the saving grace is still a Europeanized figure embodying civility absent in the depiction of "barbaric" Muslims.</p>

                <p>Similar narratives permeate many classic operas. Meyerbeer's "L'Africaine," for example, romanticizes "the Orient," portraying an Indian queen who falls for a European man who purchases her at a slave market. Local men are emasculated, while European protagonists are idealized as courageous, patriotic, and morally superior, driven by "dreams of grandeur and immortality."</p>

                <p>Contrary to possible assumptions, these portrayals don't anger me. Instead, they offer vital perspectives I wish I'd had when first encountering these classics. Now, I can simultaneously appreciate Konstanze's poignant aria about profound sorrow and critically reflect on Elizabeth Bennet's circumstances, acknowledging her potential family displacement upon her father's passing.</p>

                <p>Perhaps my perspective reflects my background as a Middle Eastern woman, but these meditations help me appreciate art more deeply, understanding diverse narratives and recognizing nuances often overlooked in traditional analyses.</p>
