                <p>The only coffee shop where I genuinely enjoy the coffee sells a cup for around $2.50. I specifically enjoy their coffee because they prepare it exactly the way I do at home, using the same brand. Interestingly, an entire box of the same coffee costs just $4.</p>

                <p>I genuinely prefer this coffee because of familiarity—it's the same brand and preparation I use myself. This made me reflect on the idea of acquired taste as a form of cultural capital.</p>

                <p>What if we consider acquired tastes as forms of cultural capital, preferences shaped profoundly by our family and environment? The concept of Cultural Capital was coined by Pierre Bourdieu in his seminal academic article, "The Forms of Capital," where he also defines economic capital (money). Bourdieu classifies three primary forms of capital: economic capital (money), social capital (connections), and cultural capital, which includes acquired tastes, behaviors, and education (elite schools, anyone?).</p>

                <p>Cultural capital serves as another marker distinguishing socio-economic classes—as if we didn't have enough of those already. You might wonder, what's the big deal? If cultural capital, much like my coffee preference, can be acquired over time, then everyone can potentially benefit from it. Indeed, it is something attainable with effort and time.</p>

                <p>However, my family's cultural capital differs significantly from what's conventionally considered prestigious. My father doesn't turn to William Shakespeare or Greek philosophers when feeling down; instead, he listens to Hassan Zerak at 2 AM. He draws inspiration not from Greek classics but from the likes of Pamuk or Pushkin. My mother admires the works of Ibn Xaidan and other Persian and Arabic Muslim scholars. Their works are equally valuable—if not more so—but often overlooked due to dominant cultural biases.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, cultural capital manifests itself uniquely across various socio-economic landscapes. My father's midnight melodies of Hassan Zerak or my mother's admiration for Ibn Xaidan's scholarship form an authentic cultural identity just as significant as any classical Western inspiration. Appreciating and recognizing the diverse manifestations of cultural capital can bridge socio-economic divides rather than deepen them, offering us a richer, broader perspective.</p>

                <p>Just as my preferred coffee reflects my acquired tastes shaped by my background and experiences, embracing diverse forms of cultural capital can enrich our understanding and appreciation of different cultures and identities.</p>
