                <p>"Mom, sometimes I feel like I have a mental illness, but then I doubt myself. Maybe I'm exaggerating."</p>

                <p>She looked at me calmly, yet firmly. "How do you think I felt when Saddam's uncle forced me out of studying physics and sent me to Tikrit to study Arabic?" Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown, was not a safe place for a Kurdish person under the Ba'athist regime. The risk was enormous.</p>

                <p>This conversation returned vividly to my mind while reading the article "How It Feels to Have Imposter Syndrome About Mental Illness." In this piece, the author describes the emotional rollercoaster she experienced upon being diagnosed with ADHD—validation followed swiftly by doubt, wondering if she'd exaggerated her symptoms to receive the diagnosis she desired.</p>

                <p>While reflecting deeply on this topic, I recalled a well-known book within our community titled, "Then Which of the Favors of Your Lord Will You Deny?" This work often emphasizes gratitude as a cornerstone value, something I've personally found comfort in. And indeed, there is value in nurturing gratitude.</p>

                <p>However, there exists within our culture a forced gratitude that can be overwhelming. Passages urging thankfulness—"Then which of the favors of your Lord will you both (jinns and men) deny?"—can inadvertently minimize the very real struggles people face. This perspective tends to overlook the genuine suffering and undeserved difficulties many encounter. The older I become and the more individuals I meet who suffer unjustly, the more frustrated I grow with this limited outlook.</p>

                <p>There's an underlying assumption that suffering from mental illness—or even simply admitting it—is somehow a sign of moral weakness or ingratitude. Even as global dialogue around mental health becomes increasingly open, within certain cultural and religious communities, stigma persists strongly. There's a lingering narrative suggesting that perhaps personal misfortunes result from past wrongdoings or insufficient gratitude.</p>

                <p>Yet, there's another form of imposter syndrome prevalent within our communities—one tied to suffering itself. People often internalize the belief, consciously or subconsciously, that their struggles pale compared to others', leaving them feeling undeserving of empathy or care.</p>

                <p>This brings me back to a vivid memory of watching a documentary about the Anfal campaign while a dear friend was simultaneously forced to abandon ballet due to circumstances beyond her control. Despite the vast differences between our circumstances and those depicted in the documentary, I realized how often we minimize our pain by comparing it to historically monumental events. We neglect our own need for acknowledgment and healing by focusing solely on the magnitude of others' tragedies.</p>

                <p>Such reflections highlight the need to break away from comparing pain and suffering. Validating your experiences, recognizing your struggles, and seeking help isn't about ingratitude—it's about honoring your own truth and caring for your mental and emotional well-being.</p>
